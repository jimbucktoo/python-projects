# python-projects

python-projects is a repository created in order for me to experiment with the python the language as well as playing with Machine Learning models.

## Technologies

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) - NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - In computer programming, pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis.
* [SciKit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) - Scikit-learn is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language.
* [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) - SciPy is a free and open-source Python library used for scientific computing and technical computing.
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy.
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - TensorFlow is an open-source software library for dataflow programming across a range of tasks. It is a symbolic math library, and is also used for machine learning applications such as neural networks.
